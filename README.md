# Ballistic Calculator .NET

100% open source windows (100% WinE compatible) ballistic calculator with accuracy and performance comparable with best commercial calculators.

The application is under development now!!! Please stay in touch. I expect the first release by ~~September 2021~~November, 2022. You can track the progress on the project page. You can share your suggestions or ideas in discussions. 

If you need something to use right now, take a look at OLD version of the application 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/ballisticcalculator/

## RISK NOTICE

The application performs very limited simulation of a complex physical process and so it performs a lot of approximations. Therefore the calculation results MUST NOT be considered as completely and reliably reflecting actual behavior or characteristics of projectiles. While these results may be used for educational purpose, they must NOT be considered as reliable for the areas where incorrect calculation may cause making a wrong decision, financial harm, or can put a human life at risk.
