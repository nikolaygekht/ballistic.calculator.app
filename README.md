# Ballistic Calculator .NET

Windows (100% WinE compatible) ballistic calculator with accurancy comparable with best commercial calculators.

The calculator is based on [Gehtsoft Open Source Ballistic Calculator](https://github.com/gehtsoft-usa/BallisticCalculator1)

## RISK NOTICE

The application performs very limited simulation of a complex physical process and so it performs a lot of approximations. Therefore the calculation results MUST NOT be considered as completely and reliably reflecting actual behavior or characteristics of projectiles. While these results may be used for educational purpose, they must NOT be considered as reliable for the areas where incorrect calculation may cause making a wrong decision, financial harm, or can put a human life at risk.

2) Go to microsoft https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0 and download [.NET 5.0 desktop runtime for *windows*](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-5.0.6-windows-x64-installer).

3) Run .NET 5.0 runtime installer using wine.

4) Run Ballistic Calculator exe file using wine.
